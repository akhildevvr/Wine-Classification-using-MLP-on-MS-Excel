# Wine Classification using MLP on MS Excel

This is an example of a pattern recognition problem where we would like to create a neural network that not only classifies the known wines properly, but can generalize to accurately classify wines.

The 13 wine attributes will act as inputs to a neural network, and the respective target for each will be a 3‚Äêelement vector with a 1 for each winery: #1, #2 or #3. Therefore the net has three outputs with activation function.

The data set consists of 178 instances and each one is described with 13 characteristics given above. The dataset can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine
